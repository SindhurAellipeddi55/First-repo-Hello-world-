# First-repo-Hello-world-
My first repo following the tutorial

Not much to mention about me. Kinda geeky boii interests are Gaming (I have a sweet spot for retro consoles, although I use emulators), Anime(will not cringe you out with weeb japanese), Coding (only a beginner, as you can see with this repo) , Math(Numberphile and 3blue1brown ftw) and Astronomy/Astrophysics.

Ambiverted boii (Rest easy my man)
